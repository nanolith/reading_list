Reading List
============

This is my current reading list.  My old reading list
eventually reached over 1000 books, so I decided to start over.  I order books
in somewhat random categories, and there is no guarantee that this list is up to
date with what I have read or not.  In fact, there are many hundreds of books
that I have read that are not here.  That's sort of the point of a reading list.
:-)

Sometimes, I'll add books that I've already read to cross them out when I'm
extracting a reading list from a third party list.  I'll try to leave
attribution when known.

Follow-Ups
----------

When I read an author I enjoy, I like to make a list of follow-up works.  Fully
grokking an author takes more than one book.

Ken Kesey
---------

Randle Patrick McMurphy in *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest* made for an
interesting character study, especially since he was seen through the eye of
Chief Bromden, who serves as the novel's Huckleberry Finn.

* ~~*One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest* by Ken Kesey~~
* *Sometimes a Great Notion* by Ken Kesey
* *Sailor Song* by Ken Kesey

Kurt Vonnegut

*Slaughterhouse-Five* was an interesting postmodernist telling of the second
world war.  I'm curious to see how Vonnegut's other works stack up.
