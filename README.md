Reading List
============

This is my current reading list, in Markdown format.  My old reading list
eventually reached over 1000 books, so I decided to start over.  I order books
in somewhat random categories, and there is no guarantee that this list is up to
date with what I have read or not.  In fact, there are many hundreds of books
that I have read that are not here.  That's sort of the point of a reading list.
:-)

Sometimes, I'll add books that I've already read to cross them out when I'm
extracting a reading list from a third party list.  I'll try to leave
attribution when known.

Literature from Strand Quiz

You can take the quiz [here][strand-quiz].  I did okay.  I know roughly half of
these title / author combinations.  But, I could do better, so clearly, I need
